# Tech Deck
Tech Deck is a piece of software which provides one unified cue list and trigger for Yamaha TF-series mixers and MagicQ lighting consoles, allowing for one single cue button to control your mix, call a lighting cue, play an audio file, and change an image on a projector. Tech Deck uses a backend written in Python and an independant frontend built with Flutter.
